    <p> Hi everyone!  I'm excited to be a part of this bootcamp.  I'm born and raised in Eastern North Carolina
        and am a graduate of East Carolina University in 2004 with a degree in Finance.  Up until now I have been
        in the retail industry, and this bootcamp will hopefully jumpstart me into a new industry.  Currently
        I live in North Raleigh with my wife, Erica; our son, Benny; and our cat, Stringer.  In my free time
        I enjoy skiing, homebrewing, collecting records, photography, architecture, and now of course coding!
    </p>
